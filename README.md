    Particle Network BTC Connect Demo (Simplified)
  </h3>
</div>

‚ö°Ô∏è Simplified demo application showcasing the implementation of BTC Connect within a standard create-react-app structure. Specifically, this demo facilitates connection through UniSat, TokenPocket, Bybit, Bitget, OKX, or Xverse and executes both a burn of 0.001 BTC on Merlin and a sample transaction on native Bitcoin.

Built using **BTC Connect (by Particle Network)**, **TypeScript**

## ‚Çø BTC Connect
BTC Connect takes advantage of ERC-4337 alongside (Bitcoin) Layer-2 EVM-compatible blockchains to leverage a Smart Account, Paymaster, Bundler natively within Bitcoin wallets (connected to through a Bitcoin-specific modal also provided by BTC Connect). As its core, BTC Connect enables existing BTC wallets to control smart accounts on Layer-2s.
